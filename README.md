# Solidity Marketplace (ConsenSys Developer Course Final Project)

This repository contains the implementation of a marketplace in Solidity. It is the final project for the ConsenSys Developer Bootcamp. 

# Requirements
## User Interface Requirements:
- [ ] Run the app on a dev server locally for testing/grading
- [ ] You should be able to visit a URL and interact with the application
- [ ] App recognizes current account
- [ ] Sign transactions using MetaMask
- [ ] Contract state is updated
	- [ ] Update reflected in UI
 
## Test Requirements:
- [ ] Write 5 tests for each contract you wrote
	- [ ] Solidity 
	- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] Explain why you wrote those tests
- [ ] Tests run with truffle test
 
## Design Pattern Requirements:
- [ ] Implement emergency stop
- [ ] What other design patterns have you used / not used?
	- [ ] Why did you choose the patterns that you did?
	- [ ] Why not others?
 
## Security Tools / Common Attacks:
- [ ] Explain what measures youâ€™ve taken to ensure that your contracts are not susceptible to common attacks

## Other
- [ ] Use a library (via EthPM)
- [ ] Integrate with an additional service, for example:
