# Solidity Marketplace (ConsenSys Developer Course Final Project)

This repository contains the implementation of a marketplace in Solidity. It is the final project for the ConsenSys Developer Bootcamp. 

# Requirements
## User Interface Requirements:
- [x] Run the app on a dev server locally for testing/grading
- [x] You should be able to visit a URL and interact with the application
- [x] App recognizes current account
- [x] Sign transactions using MetaMask
- [x] Contract state is updated
	- [x] Update reflected in UI
 
## Test Requirements:
- [x] Write 5 tests for each contract you wrote
	- [x] Solidity 
	- [x] JavaScript
- [ ] Explain why you wrote those tests
- [x] Tests run with truffle test
 
## Design Pattern Requirements:
- [ ] Implement emergency stop
- [ ] What other design patterns have you used / not used?
	- [ ] Why did you choose the patterns that you did?
	- [ ] Why not others?
 
## Security Tools / Common Attacks:
- [ ] Explain what measures youâ€™ve taken to ensure that your contracts are not susceptible to common attacks

## Other
- [ ] Use a library (via EthPM)

## Stretch Requirement
- [ ] Integrate with an additional service, for example:
	- [ ] IPFS
	- [ ] uPort
	- [ ] Ethereum Name Service
	- [ ] Oracle
